# Azure Functions GraphQL Sample with CosmosDB

This repository contains a sample of how to run a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) server on [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/functions/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-aapowell) using [Hot Chocolate](https://hotchocolate.io/) as a .NET GraphQL server, then integrating with [CosmosDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-aapowell).

You can read more on how to build this [on my blog](https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2020-09-04-graphql-on-azure-part-4-serverless-comsosdb/).
